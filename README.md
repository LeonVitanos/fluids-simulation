# Fluids Simulation

This projects describes our implementation of fluid simulation, which is based on the provided implementation of a basic 2D fluid simulator by Jos Stam. The simulation supports basic interaction with fluids using the mouse to add density and velocity fields, as well as between the fluids with fixed objects, solid and rigid bodies with the help of boundaries. Interaction between the fluids and the particle system, is also supported.
